# Lead tracker - chrome extension
This is a chrome extension that you can use locally to track URL's as an agenda while you are browsing.
<br>
Ideally, the extension is very handy when used to automatically track any leads just by adding the URL's and making a list.
<br>
You then can copy and paste your list at the end.
<br>
<br>
Once you have the files locally:
1) Open Chrome and go to "Extensions", by clicking on the small puzzle piece on the navigation menu on the top right-hand side of the window.
2) Activate the developer mode, and upload your file as a new extension.
3) Now, you should be able to see the extension and use it! If you don't try pressing on "update".
